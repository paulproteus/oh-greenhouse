        <p> The DAT Overview is a tool designed to help the Ubuntu Developer
        Advisory Team in its mission to:<p>
        <br>
            <li>Reach out to new contributors, thank them for their work and get feedback.</li>
            <li>Reach out to people who might be ready to apply for upload rights and help them.</li>
            <li>Reach out to contributors that went inactive and get feedback from them and offer help.</li>
        <br>
        <p>Currently you must be a member of the team to use the DAT Overview.
        In the future, we hope to provide publicly viewable anonymized data that
        helps give a picture of the Ubuntu contributor community.</p>
